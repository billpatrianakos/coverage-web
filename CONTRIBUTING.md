# Contributing

In order to contribute there are two rules:

1. Always commit to either your own unique branch or the `develop` branch
2. Clean code is good code so follow the code style guide

If you can follow those two rules then the process of contributing code looks like this:

1. Fork this project
2. Make your changes but __switch to the `develop` branch first!__
3. Go to your fork and press the green Pull Request button
4. Set up the request so that the changes you made in your fork will be merged into our `develop` branch

## Branching

We use a simple branching strategy:

- `master` is the latest stable version of the software (it's likely running online if it's on `master`)
- `develop` is where the cutting edge stuff goes. We all merge our individual branches into `develop` when we're finished
- `dev-YOUR_NAME` is your own copy of the `develop` branch you merge into from time to time
