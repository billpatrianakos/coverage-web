# Coverage Web

> The official web client for Coverage

## What it does

Coverage is an open source health insurance coverage finder. Insurance companies get rich by making insurance confusing. Most people end up choosing plans they don't understand, that don't cover the doctors they want to go to, have high premiums *and* out-of-pocket costs and just plain suck.

Coverage helps you find the health insurance plan that's right for your needs and budget, putting your health care above profits. Coverage is completely free and open source software. I don't make a dime off of this. It's just the right thing to do.

## Setup

*Coverage requires Node.js > v5.4.1 and the following installed globally:*

- Bower
- Gulp (local package and CLI)
- PM2
- Mocha
- Browserify
- Run `npm install -g bower gulp-cli mocha pm2 browserify` to install all global dependencies at once
